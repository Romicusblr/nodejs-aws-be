# What was done
- [x] product-service serverless config contains configuration for 2 lambda functions, API is not working at all, but YAML configuration is correct
- [x] The getProductsList OR getProductsById lambda function returns a correct response (POINT1)
- [x] The getProductsById AND getProductsList lambda functions return a correct response code (POINT2)
- [x] Your own Frontend application is integrated with product service (/products API) and products from product-service are represented on Frontend. AND POINT1 and POINT2 are done.

# Additional (optional) tasks (but nice to have):

- [x] Async/await is used in lambda functions
- [x] ES6 modules are used for product-service implementation
- [x] Webpack is configured for product-service
- [ ] (All languages) - SWAGGER documentation is created for product-service
- [x] (All languages) - Lambda handlers are covered by basic UNIT tests (NO infrastructure logic is needed to be covered)
- [x] (All languages) - Lambda handlers (getProductsList, getProductsById) code is written not in 1 single module (file) and separated in codebase.
- [ ] (All languages) - Main error scenarious are handled by API ("Product not found" error).
